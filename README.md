## 📖 What is ORB Mining?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="60%">

ORB is a **lottery-style mining game** on Solana where:
- 🎲 Each round has a 5x5 grid (25 blocks/squares)
- 💰 Miners deploy SOL to blocks to claim space proportionally
- 🎯 One random **winning block** is chosen - ALL miners on that block win
- 🏆 Winners **share** rewards proportionally: SOL from losers + 4 ORB + motherload (1/625 chance)
- 🤖 **This bot deploys to all 25 blocks** to maximize win probability

<summary>🎲 <b>Monte Carlo Optimization Details</b> (click to expand)</summary>

### Monte Carlo Optimization

This bot uses **10,000-simulation Monte Carlo analysis** to determine optimal bet sizing for every motherload tier. Unlike simple bots that use fixed deployment amounts, this bot's strategy was mathematically optimized through extensive probabilistic modeling:

- **10,000+ Simulations Per Tier**: Each motherload tier (200-299 ORB, 300-399 ORB, etc.) was tested through 10,000 independent mining simulations
- **Multi-Strategy Testing**: Four different strategies (Conservative, Ultra Conservative, Extreme Conservative, etc.) were compared head-to-head
- **Risk-Adjusted Optimization**: The chosen tier configuration maximizes expected ROI while minimizing risk of ruin (< 5% chance of losing 80%+ of capital)
- **Proven Performance**: Monte Carlo analysis shows +139% average ROI with current settings vs +74% with naive fixed-bet strategies
- **Real Probability Modeling**: Accounts for 1/625 win chance, 95% SOL return rate, 10% refining fee, and variable competition levels

**Example Results from Monte Carlo Testing:**
- 700-799 ORB motherload: 240 rounds @ 0.42% budget/round = **+172% ROI** (peak performance tier)
- 1000-1099 ORB motherload: 120 rounds @ 0.83% budget/round = **+125% ROI**
- 200-299 ORB motherload: 440 rounds @ 0.23% budget/round = **+74% ROI** (ultra-conservative for low rewards)

</details>

<details>
<summary>📐 <b>Kelly Criterion Principles</b> (click to expand)</summary>

### Kelly Criterion Principles

While not using the classical Kelly Criterion formula directly (due to the lottery-style mechanics), this bot implements **fractional Kelly bankroll management**:

- **Fractional Betting**: Never risks more than ~1.67% of total budget per round (even at max aggression)
- **Edge-Based Sizing**: Deploys larger amounts when "edge" is favorable (high motherload = higher EV)
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Automatically scales bet size up/down as motherload (reward pool) changes
- **Ruin Prevention**: Extreme conservative tiers (400+ rounds) when motherload is low to preserve capital
- **Optimal Growth**: Tier system balances between maximizing growth rate and minimizing bankruptcy risk

**Kelly-Inspired Tier Logic:**
- **High Edge** (1200+ ORB motherload): Aggressive 60 rounds = ~1.67% per round
- **Medium Edge** (700-799 ORB): Moderate 240 rounds = ~0.42% per round
- **Low Edge** (200-299 ORB): Conservative 440 rounds = ~0.23% per round
- **Minimal Edge** (0-199 ORB): Maximum conservation 880 rounds = ~0.11% per round

This fractional approach prevents over-betting (Kelly criterion's primary insight) while adapting to changing reward conditions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📊 <b>Real-Time Expected Value (EV) Calculation</b> (click to expand)</summary>

### Real-Time Expected Value (EV) Calculation

The bot doesn't blindly deploy - it calculates profitability **for every single round** before committing capital:

1. **Fetches Live Competition**: Reads `totalDeployed` from on-chain Round account to get REAL current competition (not estimates)
2. **Calculates Your Share**: Determines your exact percentage of total deployment
   ```
   Your Share = Your Deployment / (Total Competition + Your Deployment)
   ```
3. **Gets Current ORB Price**: Fetches live ORB/SOL price from Jupiter DEX
4. **Computes Expected Value**:
   ```
   Base Reward Expected = Your Share × 4 ORB
   Motherload Expected = (1/625 chance) × Your Share × Motherload ORB
   Total ORB Expected = (Base + Motherload) × 0.9 (after 10% refining fee)
   SOL Expected Back = Your Deployment × 0.95

   EV = (ORB Expected × ORB Price) + SOL Expected Back - Your Deployment
   ```
5. **Only Mines When EV > 0**: Skips unprofitable rounds automatically

**Example EV Calculation:**
```
Your Deployment: 0.18 SOL
Total Competition: 7.77 SOL (from on-chain Round data)
Your Share: 2.3%
ORB Price: 0.124 SOL ($24.80)
Expected ORB: 0.112 ORB × 0.124 = 0.014 SOL
Expected SOL Back: 0.174 SOL
Expected Value: 0.014 + 0.174 - 0.18 = +0.008 SOL (4.4% ROI) ✅ PROFITABLE
```

This protects you from mining when competition is too high or ORB price crashes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔄 <b>Dynamic Scaling & Auto-Restart</b> (click to expand)</summary>

### Dynamic Scaling & Auto-Restart

The bot **continuously monitors motherload changes** and automatically adjusts strategy:

- **50%+ Motherload Increase**: Closes automation, reclaims SOL, recreates with larger deployments
  - Example: 300 ORB → 500 ORB = restart with 67% larger bets to maximize EV
- **40%+ Motherload Decrease**: Closes automation, recreates with smaller deployments to reduce risk
  - Example: 500 ORB → 280 ORB = restart with 44% smaller bets to preserve capital
- **Seamless Transitions**: No manual intervention needed - bot detects, closes, and restarts automatically
- **Capital Preservation**: Always reclaims remaining SOL before restart (nothing wasted)

This ensures you're **always betting optimally** for current market conditions, not using outdated strategy from hours ago.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🛡️ <b>Risk Management Features</b> (click to expand)</summary>

### Risk Management Features

Multiple layers of protection prevent catastrophic losses:

1. **Motherload Threshold Gate**: Won't mine unless rewards >= configurable threshold (default: 100 ORB)
2. **Production Cost Check**: Skips rounds where EV < 0 (protects against high competition or low ORB price)
3. **Minimum Price Floor**: Won't swap ORB below configurable USD price (default: $30)
4. **Safety Reserve**: Always keeps minimum ORB balance (configurable, prevents selling everything)
5. **Minimum SOL Balance**: Maintains wallet SOL reserve for tx fees (default: 0.1 SOL)
6. **Fractional Bankroll**: Never risks more than small % of total capital per round
7. **Auto-Depletion Detection**: Closes automation immediately when budget exhausted (reclaims dust)

</details>

<details>
<summary>📝 <b>Profitability Transparency</b> (click to expand)</summary>

### Profitability Transparency

Unlike black-box bots, this shows you **exactly why** it's mining or waiting:

**When Profitable:**
```
[DEBUG] Production Cost Analysis (Profitable):
  Competition: REAL on-chain data (42.5x)
  Your Share: 2.30%
  Production Cost: 0.182800 SOL
  Expected ORB: 0.1123 ORB × 0.123706 SOL = 0.013894 SOL
  Expected SOL Back: 0.173660 SOL
  Expected Value (EV): +0.004754 SOL
  ROI: 2.60%
  Profitable: ✅ YES
```

**When Unprofitable:**
```
[WARNING] Unprofitable conditions (EV: -0.001234 SOL) - waiting...
[DEBUG] Motherload: 150.00 ORB, ORB Price: 0.050000 SOL
[DEBUG] Competition too high for current ORB price - skipping round
```

You can verify the math yourself - full breakdown logged for every decision.

## 💰 Development Fee

**This bot includes a 0.1% development fee on each mining deployment.**

- **Fee Amount:** 0.1% of each SOL deployment (10 basis points)
- **Purpose:** Supports ongoing development and maintenance of the bot
- **Transparency:** The fee is automatically deducted on each deployment transaction

Example: If you deploy 1 SOL to mine, 0.001 SOL (0.1%) goes to the development wallet, and 0.999 SOL is deployed for mining.

## 💵 Cost and Profitability

<div align="center">

| Cost Type | Amount | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 💎 **Deployment** | Variable | Bot scales based on motherload (0.11%-1.67% per round) |
| ⛽ **Transaction Fees** | ~0.001 SOL | Per deployment (~$0.20 @ $200/SOL) |
| 💱 **Swap Fees** | ~0.5% | Jupiter DEX fees when converting ORB to SOL |
| 🔧 **Dev Fee** | 0.1% | Supports ongoing development |

</div>

### 🎯 Smart Profitability Checking

The bot features **intelligent profitability checking** using real-time blockchain data:

1. **Fetches actual Round data** - Reads `totalDeployed` from the current Round account
2. **Calculates your exact share** - Determines your percentage of total competition
3. **Gets current ORB price** - Fetches live ORB/SOL price from Jupiter
4. **Computes Expected Value (EV)** - Calculates if mining is profitable:
   ```
   EV = (Expected ORB × ORB Price) + Expected SOL Back - Production Cost
   ```
5. **Only mines when EV > 0** - Skips unprofitable rounds automatically

**Example Calculation:**
- Your deployment: 0.18 SOL/round
- Total competition: 7.77 SOL (from Round account)
- Your share: 2.3% of total deployment
- ORB price: 0.124 SOL ($17.40)
- Expected ORB: 0.112 ORB × 0.124 = 0.014 SOL
- Expected SOL back: 0.174 SOL
- **Expected Value: +0.0048 SOL (2.6% ROI) ✅ PROFITABLE**

**Configuration:**
```env
# Enable/disable production cost checking
ENABLE_PRODUCTION_COST_CHECK=true

# Minimum EV required (0 = break-even or better)
MIN_EXPECTED_VALUE=0

# Fallback estimate when Round data unavailable
ESTIMATED_COMPETITION_MULTIPLIER=20
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Accurate decisions** - Uses real competition, not guesses
- ✅ **Protects against losses** - Won't mine when ORB price is too low
- ✅ **Adapts to market** - Automatically adjusts to current conditions
- ✅ **Maximizes EV** - Only deploys when mathematically profitable
