# Mining Thresholds & Dynamic Scaling
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Only mine when global motherload >= this value (profitability check)
#
# DYNAMIC SCALING: Bot automatically adjusts deployment amounts based on motherload
# Strategy: As motherload GROWS, bot deploys MORE SOL per round (better EV)
#
# Motherload Tiers (automatically calculated at setup):
#   200-299 ORB: Very conservative (120 rounds, ~0.83% budget per round)
#   300-399 ORB: Conservative (100 rounds, 1% budget per round)
#   400-499 ORB: Moderate (80 rounds, ~1.25% budget per round)
#   500-599 ORB: Aggressive (60 rounds, ~1.67% budget per round)
#   600-699 ORB: Very aggressive (45 rounds, ~2.2% budget per round)
#   700-999 ORB: Maximum aggression (30 rounds, ~3.3% budget per round)
#   1000+ ORB: Ultra aggressive (20 rounds, 5% budget per round)
#
# AUTO-RESTART: Bot automatically closes and recreates automation when:
#   - Motherload increases by 50%+ (AND at least 100 ORB increase)
#   - Motherload decreases by 40%+ (AND at least 100 ORB decrease)
# This ensures deployment amounts stay optimal as market conditions change.
#
# ODDS: 1 in 625 chance per deployment (each turn is independent)
# Deploying to all 25 squares maximizes chances each round.
MOTHERLOAD_THRESHOLD=400

# How often to check for new rounds (milliseconds)
CHECK_ROUND_INTERVAL_MS=5000

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Production Cost Profitability Analysis (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Enable production cost check before mining
# When enabled, bot calculates Expected Value (EV) and only mines when profitable
#
# EV = (Expected ORB × ORB Price) + Expected SOL Back - Production Cost
#
# This prevents mining at a loss when:
# - ORB price is too low relative to production cost
# - Competition is too high relative to rewards
# - Motherload is too small to justify the risk
ENABLE_PRODUCTION_COST_CHECK=true

# Minimum Expected Value (EV) required to mine (SOL)
# 0 = mine as long as EV is positive (break-even or better)
# 0.001 = require at least 0.001 SOL profit per round
# Set higher to be more selective about mining conditions
MIN_EXPECTED_VALUE=0

# Estimated competition multiplier
# This estimates how much competition you face relative to your deployment
# Example: 10 = assume other miners deploy 10x your amount
# - Lower value (5) = assume less competition, more optimistic
# - Higher value (20) = assume more competition, more conservative
# Adjust based on observed market conditions
ESTIMATED_COMPETITION_MULTIPLIER=20

# Auto-Claim Thresholds
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Auto-claim SOL rewards when balance >= this (SOL)
AUTO_CLAIM_SOL_THRESHOLD=0.1

# Auto-claim ORB rewards from mining when balance >= this (ORB)
# Each claim costs ~0.00005 SOL. Consider setting higher (5.0+) to reduce fee waste
AUTO_CLAIM_ORB_THRESHOLD=5.0

# Auto-claim ORB rewards from staking when balance >= this (ORB)
# IMPORTANT: Set higher to avoid excessive transaction fees!
# Each claim costs ~0.00005 SOL in fees. Claiming too frequently wastes money.
# Recommended: 5.0 or higher (wait for meaningful amounts before claiming)
AUTO_CLAIM_STAKING_ORB_THRESHOLD=5.0

# How often to check rewards for claiming (milliseconds)
# 30000 = 30 seconds, 300000 = 5 minutes (recommended)
# Checking every 30 seconds is fine, but set higher thresholds above to avoid frequent claims
CHECK_REWARDS_INTERVAL_MS=30000

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Auto-Swap Settings (Refund Automation Account)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Enable auto-swapping ORB to SOL when automation balance is low
AUTO_SWAP_ENABLED=true

# Minimum ORB price in USD to allow swapping (USD per ORB)
# Bot won't swap if ORB price is below this threshold (protects against selling at low prices)
# Examples: 0 = swap at any price, 30.00 = only swap when ORB >= $30.00
MIN_ORB_PRICE_USD=30

# Never go below this ORB balance (safety reserve)
# Set to 0 to swap ALL ORB, or keep some as reserve
MIN_ORB_TO_KEEP=0

# Minimum ORB amount required to trigger a swap (ORB)
# Bot won't swap if available ORB (balance - MIN_ORB_TO_KEEP) is below this
# Examples: 0.1 = need at least 0.1 ORB to swap, 1.0 = need at least 1 ORB
MIN_ORB_SWAP_AMOUNT=0.1
